SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B hsh
command interpreter, or shell, is a versatile tool for executing commands. It offers both interactive and non-interactive modes of operation.

.SH SYNOPSIS

To run in interactive mode, simply execute:

.B ./hsh

To run in non-interactive mode, you can pass a command string or file through a pipe:

.B echo [command_string | file] | ./hsh

.SH FUNCTIONALITY

.B hsh
supports built-in commands like
.I exit
and
.I env,
in addition to executing external commands.

In interactive mode, it provides a prompt for user input, allowing commands to be entered and executed line by line.

In non-interactive mode, it reads commands from a file or command string provided via standard input.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION

When a command is entered, the shell identifies the command name and its arguments. If the command is a built-in, it executes the built-in command. Otherwise, it searches for the command in the PATH environment variable and executes it if found.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS

The shell includes built-in commands that perform specific functions:

.B env

Print the current environment variables.
.B exit

Cause the shell to exit, with the exit status reflecting the last executed command.
.SH RETURN VALUE

The return value of the last executed command is available for use after the shell encounters the
.I EOF
condition (end-of-file) or when the built-in
.I exit
command is invoked.

.SH ERROR HANDLING

When a command encounters an error, the shell provides clear error messages to aid troubleshooting:

.BR
$ echo "non-interactive" | ./hsh
.BR
./hsh: 1: non-interactive: not found
.BR
$
